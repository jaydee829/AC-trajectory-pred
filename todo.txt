- Fix normalization - DONE
	- moving average
	- determine from training data
	- batch normalization?
	- normalize per batch
- 1D Conv + RNN with residual connections
- Extra dense layers before final out
- LR on plateau callback - DONE
- other callbacks (csvlogger? modelcheckpoint?) - Done
- mse over mae for loss - DONE
- remove points prior to takeoff
- build generator for validation data
	- discover how to run validation data on a model by itself
- build graph code to overlay a flight with the predictions like for 696
- look at downsampling data to remove repeated points
